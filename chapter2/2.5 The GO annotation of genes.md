1. First，we need to load the annotation database library named or.Hs.og into our R session, as we have been doing before, by using the following command:


```R
library(org.Hs.eg.db)
```

    Loading required package: AnnotationDbi
    Loading required package: stats4
    Loading required package: BiocGenerics
    Loading required package: parallel
    
    Attaching package: 'BiocGenerics'
    
    The following objects are masked from 'package:parallel':
    
        clusterApply, clusterApplyLB, clusterCall, clusterEvalQ,
        clusterExport, clusterMap, parApply, parCapply, parLapply,
        parLapplyLB, parRapply, parSapply, parSapplyLB
    
    The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
    
        IQR, mad, sd, var, xtabs
    
    The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
    
        anyDuplicated, append, as.data.frame, basename, cbind, colMeans,
        colnames, colSums, dirname, do.call, duplicated, eval, evalq,
        Filter, Find, get, grep, grepl, intersect, is.unsorted, lapply,
        lengths, Map, mapply, match, mget, order, paste, pmax, pmax.int,

2. We assume that the genes are in the form of Entrez gene IDs; otherwise, as explained before, it's good to convert them ad follows:


```R
myEIDs <- c("1","10","100")
```

3. We now use these keys to find the GO annotation for each of our genes as follows: 


```R
myGO <- org.Hs.egGO[[myEIDs[1]]]
```

4. We can do this in one go for all the genes using the mget function as follows:


```R
myGO_All <- mget(myEIDs,org.Hs.egGO)
```

5. It is also possible to perform the mapping in the reverse manner, that is, from GO term ID to Entrez genes as follows: 


```R
GOgenes <- org.Hs.egGO2ALLEGS[["GO:0008150"]]
```

6. To get genes for all the input GO terms, we again use the mget function as follows:


```R
GOterm <- c("GO:0008150"，"GO:0001909")
```


    Error in parse(text = x, srcfile = src): <text>:1:25: unexpected input
    1: GOterm <- c("GO:0008150"n                            ^
    Traceback:
    



```R
GOgenes_All <- mget(Goterm, org.Hs.egGO2ALLEGS)
```


    Error in mget(Goterm, org.Hs.egGO2ALLEGS): 找不到对象'Goterm'
    Traceback:
    

    1. mget(Goterm, org.Hs.egGO2ALLEGS)
