1. Load the seqinr library with the help of the following command:


```R
library(seqinr)
```

2. Read the FASTA file from its location( provide the complete path if not in the current working directory) as follows:

从当前工作目录读取FASTA文件，如果不在当前工作目录，需要加入文件所在目录位置。
                                        


```R
getwd()
```


'C:/Users/Administrator/bioinformatics_with_R'



```R
mysequence <- read.fasta(file="Hbsbeta鸟类数据原始序列.fasta")
```

3. Choose GenBank as the data bank for your queries with the following command:

选择genbank数据库


```R
choosebank("genBank")
```

    Warning message in socketConnection(host = host, port = port, server = server, blocking = blocking, :
    "pbil.univ-lyon1.fr:5558 cannot be opened"


    Error in choosebank("genBank"): I wasn't able to open the socket connection:
       o Check that your are connected to the internet.
       o Check that port 5558 is not closed by a firewall.
       o Try to increase timeout value (current is 5 seconds).
    
    Traceback:
    

    1. choosebank("genBank")

    2. stop(errmess)


4. Now, query GenBank for a keyword of interest(in our case, we look for BRCA1) by typing the following command:

关键词查找


```R
query(listmane="BRCA1", query="SP=homo saapiens AND K=BRCA1")
```

5. To look for the sequence identifiers, extract the name attribute of the sequences as follows:

查看序列标识符


```R
myseqs <- getSequence(BRCA1)
mynames <- getName(BRCA1)
```

6. Check the number of hits by simply checking the length of the mynames object that contains the names of the sequences found in the hits as a verctor, with the help of the following command:




```R
length(mynames)
```

7. Try writing the retrieved sequence data carrying information in different fields as multiple sequences (this is only applicable if more than one sequence was retrieved, otherwise you will receive a single sequence) in a FASTA file named MyBRCA.fasta as follows:

将检索结果写入fasta格式文件中


```R
wirte.fasta(myseqs,mynames, file.out = "MYBRCA.fasta")
```

8. As suggested earlier, close the dat bank after the query by typing the following command in order to avoid working with multiple banks:


```R
closebank()
```
