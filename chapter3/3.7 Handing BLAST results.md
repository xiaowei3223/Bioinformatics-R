1. Install and load the following functions of RFLPtools into your R session that reads
the BLAST results:


```R
install.packages("RFLPtools",dependencies=TRUE)
library(RFLPtools)
```

    Warning message:
    "unable to access index for repository http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/RWin/bin/windows/contrib/3.5:
      无法打开URL'http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/RWin/bin/windows/contrib/3.5/PACKAGES'"

    package 'RFLPtools' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked
    
    The downloaded binary packages are in
    	C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Temp\RtmpUjB2hD\downloaded_packages
    

    Loading required package: RColorBrewer
    

2. Use the built-in blast result from the package for a demo here. To specify the file,
type the following commands:


```R
DIR <- system.file("extdata", package = "RFLPtools")
MyFile <- file.path(DIR, "BLASTexample.txt")
```

3. To read the file, simply use the following command:


```R
MyBLAST <- read.blast(file = MyFile)
```

4. If the BLAST results are from a standalone BLAST, use the RFLP library's read.
blast function, as follows, to read the MyblastRes.txt BLAST file into a
data frame


```R
MyBLAST <- read.blast(file="MyblastRes.txt")
```

    Warning message in file(file, "rt"):
    "无法打开文件'MyblastRes.txt': No such file or directory"


    Error in file(file, "rt"): 无法打开链结
    Traceback:
    

    1. read.blast(file = "MyblastRes.txt")

    2. read.table(file = file, header = FALSE, sep = sep, quote = "\"", 
     .     dec = ".", fill = TRUE, comment.char = "", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

    3. file(file, "rt")


5. In case you did not use the BLAST program but used the web-based tools to get the
myAlign.txt file, you can still read the file as a data frame with the following set
of commands:


```R
MyBLAST2 <- read.csv(file="myAlign.txt", head=TRUE, sep=",")
```

6. Take a look at the read in data contents:


```R
head(MyBlast2)
```

7. The RFLPtool package also allows the computing/extracting of similar matrices out
of the data frame as follows:


```R
mySimMat <- simMatrix(MyBLAST)
```
